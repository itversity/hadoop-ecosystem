    "Let us understand HDFS Architecture. HDFS is one of the core components of Hadooop.\n",
    "* HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System.\n",
    "* Hadoop cluster typically have 3 types of nodes.\n",
    "  * Gateway Nodes - where applications are typically deployed.\n",
    "  * Master Nodes - which will manage the service.\n",
    "  * Worker Nodes - which will take care of heavy lifting.\n",
    "* Here are the typical master node configurations of HDFS.\n",
    "  * Namenode and Secondary Namenode\n",
    "  * HA Configuration - Active and Passive Namenodes\n",
    "* Namenode maintains metadata of the files while Datanodes contain blocks associated with files.\n",
    "* Our lab is built using Namenode and Secondary Namenode configuration.\n",
    "* You can review by getting into management tools or Namenode UI.\n",
    "* As a developer you should be familiar with block size and replication factor. HDFS Files are distributed based up on block size and reliability is taken care using replication factor.\n",
    "* We can also get the details about HDFS properties by reviewing following files.\n",
    "  * /etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml\n",
